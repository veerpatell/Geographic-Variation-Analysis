## Analysis and Interpretation
Our analysis reveals a positive trend in Medicare reimbursement per hospitalization, with both service mix changes and individual DRG payment changes making substantial contributions to this increase. Notably, the "Top 10" DRGs in both categories had a positive impact, while the "Bottom 10" DRGs had a negative impact on reimbursement.

The absence of certain DRG codes in either 2019 or 2021 may be indicative of changes in healthcare services, regulatory updates, or shifts in patient demographics. These changes have financial implications and can affect how hospitals are reimbursed for specific procedures.

## Reasons for Increase
The increased Medicare reimbursement per hospitalization can be attributed to several key factors:

- **Change in Cost**: A significant portion of the increase can be explained by changes in the cost of healthcare services. Further investigation is needed to identify specific services where costs have risen and the drivers behind these cost increases.

- **Technology Advancements**: Advances in medical technology and treatment options likely played a role in the increased reimbursement. New and more advanced procedures often come with higher reimbursement rates.

- **Policy Changes**: Notably, a substantial policy change occurred on April 15, 2020, when Section 3710 of the CARES Act increased Inpatient Prospective Payment System COVID-19 diagnosis-related group (DRG) reimbursement rates by 20%. This change had a significant impact on Medicare reimbursement rates.

- **Increased Use of Generic Drugs**: The increased utilization of generic drugs may have contributed to the overall decrease in the cost of certain procedures, such as AUTOLOGOUS BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT WITH CC/MCC in 2021.
