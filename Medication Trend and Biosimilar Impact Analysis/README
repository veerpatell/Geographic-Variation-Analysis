# Medication Cost Trends Analysis (2018-2021)

## Introduction
We are excited to share the findings from our recent analysis of medication cost trends between 2018 and 2021. These insights shed light on the changing landscape of healthcare expenditures and the driving forces behind these transformations.

## Total Change in Medication Cost PMPM (Per Member Per Month)
Our analysis uncovered a significant total change in medication cost PMPM during the span of 2018 to 2021. Specifically, there was a noticeable increase of $30.65 PMPM within this period. This substantial shift in healthcare spending merits further exploration and consideration in healthcare policy planning.

## Top 10 Medications with the Highest PMPM Increases
We have identified the top 10 medications that experienced the most substantial PMPM increases between 2018 and 2021. These medications are as follows:

1. Keytruda
2. Darzalex Faspro
3. Eylea
4. Rituxan
5. Prolia*
6. Imfinzi
7. Tecentriq
8. Mvasi
9. Tepezza
10. Entyvio

These findings offer valuable insights into the medications that have witnessed the most significant cost increases. This information could serve as a foundation for further research and policy considerations.

## Entyvio Payment Increase Breakdown
We observed a remarkable payment increase of over $283 million for the medication Entyvio in 2021. To gain a deeper understanding of the driving factors behind this increase, we conducted a detailed breakdown analysis, which revealed:

- Increase Due to More Patients: $187,686,210.10
- Increase Due to Per-Patient Cost: $95,834,855.52

Notably, approximately 33.81% of the increase can be attributed to per-patient cost, while the remaining 66.19% results from an increase in the number of patients using the medication. This analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of cost increases for specific medications and can inform strategies for cost containment.

## Gross Impact of Biosimilars in 2021
Biosimilar versions of certain drugs have played a pivotal role in mitigating overall healthcare costs by offering lower per-patient costs than reference products. In 2021, the gross impact of biosimilars amounted to $307,921,066. This underscores the significance of biosimilars in managing healthcare expenditures and presents an opportunity for further research into their impact on the pharmaceutical landscape.

We hope that these findings contribute to a better understanding of medication cost trends and their implications for the healthcare industry.
