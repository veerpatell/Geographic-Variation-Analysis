# Pneumococcal Vaccine Coverage Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Pneumococcal Vaccine Coverage Analysis. This analysis focuses on evaluating vaccine coverage, specifically for pneumococcal vaccination among individuals aged 65 and above in the year 2020, using CDC data. The analysis aims to identify areas with disparities in vaccine coverage and provide recommendations to address them.

## Key Findings

**Hot Spots:**
- Our analysis has identified several "hot spots" with below-average pneumococcal vaccine coverage rates. Notable states in this category include New Jersey, New York, Mississippi, and Florida.

**Racial Disparities:**
- Among the different racial groups, we observed significant disparities in vaccine coverage. The White population exhibited the highest vaccine coverage rate, with a minimum state coverage of 64%. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the lowest vaccine coverage rate, with a minimum state coverage of 41%. Black and other racial groups showed better vaccine coverage rates compared to Hispanics.

## Data and Methodology

- **Data Source:** The analysis is based on data obtained from the CDC's vaccine coverage dataset for the year 2020.
- **Analysis Tools:** We utilized [EXCEL, POWERBI] for data processing and analysis.
- **Analysis Method:** The analysis employed a method to identify "hot spots" and assess disparities in vaccine coverage among racial groups.

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to address the identified disparities:

1. **Expand Access to Vaccination Clinics:** Increase the availability of vaccination clinics in the identified "hot spot" states, with a focus on improving access for vulnerable populations.
2. **Targeted Outreach and Education Campaigns:** Implement targeted outreach and education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for seniors, particularly in areas with lower coverage rates.
3. **Collaboration with Community Leaders and Organizations:** Partner with local community leaders and organizations to build trust and facilitate vaccination efforts, especially within underserved communities.
4. **Monitor and Evaluate Progress:** Establish a robust monitoring and evaluation system to track vaccination progress and make data-driven adjustments to the strategies.
